                    <p>Hi, my name is Ben. I grew up in Roseville, Minnesota and stayed there until I moved to St. Paul for college. I graduating from Hamline University in 2009 and my first job out of college was at a store called Game Crazy. I worked a few other retail jobs, including being a Bank Teller at Wells Fargo before I got a job at The Art Institutes. I started working in their accounting department and moved over to financial aid after 1 year. I got a job at Rasmussen College 2 years later and have been there for the past 2 years.</p>
                    <P>i am a big fan of Star Trek, playing board games with friends and binge watching Netflix.</P>
                    <p>I live in St Paul with my wife Brittany. We like going on trips together and hiking. We have been married for 5 years and have known eachother since our first day of college 14 years ago.</p>
