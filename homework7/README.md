Instead of having the user choose movie-this, concert-in-town, spotify-this-song or do-what-it-says, the user has to choose from one of those 4 options. If we comment out lines 21 - 39 and then comment back in lines 19,20 and 119, it will make the user first pick their option and then the movie, song or band they want to inquire about.
